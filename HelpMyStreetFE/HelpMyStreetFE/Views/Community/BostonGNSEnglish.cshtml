                        Good Neighbour Schemes are run by local volunteers who provide day to day support for other residents who may need help on an occasional or regular basis. For older people, this support may enable them to live independently in their own homes and communities for longer and reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.

                    <p>Good Neighbour Schemes are community projects run and delivered by groups of local volunteers. Whilst potentially benefiting the whole community, they are aimed primarily at helping elderly, disabled, vulnerable, frail or isolated people. Help is given to those in need free of charge although a reasonable charge is usually made for transport mileage.</p>
                    <p><strong>What can you help with?</strong></p>
                    <p>Good Neighbour Schemes respond to the needs of local people by providing help with activities such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Befriending, home visiting, companionship, someone to go to social events with</li>
                        <li>Dog walking and caring for pets during holiday or illness</li>
                        <li>Errands and shopping</li>
                        <li>Filling in forms, writing letters, reading and help to use computers and the internet</li>
                        <li>Gardening</li>
                        <li>Giving lifts to a GP surgery, clinic, hospital, Day Centre, other appointments</li>
                        <li>Household tasks including tuning televisions, changing light bulbs and smoke alarms</li>
                        <li>Moving furniture, taking down and hanging curtains and pictures</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is about local people helping their neighbours to enjoy a better quality of life. Good Neighbour Schemes help create an environment where people feel safe and secure because they have genuine connection with one another.</p>
                    <p><strong>How do I request help?</strong></p>
