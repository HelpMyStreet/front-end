                        <p><strong>About the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme support opportunities</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            There are a number of locations spread across the county that have already been designated to deliver vaccinations. As the centres continue to invite people in for their vaccinations, they will need volunteers to help support the smooth running of the sites and be a friendly, supportive face and voice to the people who attend for their vaccinations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a volunteer you will be provided with appropriate PPE (protective wear) and training, and could be undertaking tasks such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>guiding cars into the car park</li>
                                <li>helping people find their way around the site</li>
                                <li>screening (questioning) people on arrival to check that they do not have any Covid-19 symptoms</li>
                                <li>making sure people are ready for their vaccination and know what to do</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>
                            If you're an approachable and caring person, sign up now to view open shifts and offer your support to help us deliver a fast and effective vaccination programme. Please note, there is no minimum commitment for volunteers, but you will be expected to turn up on time and stay for the whole shift for any shifts you choose to accept.

                            <strong>Our vision for community volunteers</strong>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond COVID, we would also like to build a maintain a team of volunteers who can support their communities in other ways, for example, to help local communities affected by flooding, or to tackle local issues like loneliness and isolation. There are lots of opportunities to help which we hope to build into this platform over time, so please don't hesitate to register your interest by signing up today.
