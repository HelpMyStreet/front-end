            <p>Age UK Mid Mersey is an independent, registered charity working with and on behalf of older people in Halton, Knowsley, St Helens and Warrington.</p>
            <p><strong>Important COVID-19 Update</strong><br />Sadly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to put many of our face to face services and activities on hold for the time being. However, Age UK Mid Mersey remains committed to providing the best support possible to older people in our local communities. We are still here to help and can offer Information and Advice, FREE benefit checks and Home Energy checks, wellbeing support and signposting. </p>
            <p>Here are a few of the services we offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Befriending service</strong>, our visitor and telephone befriending services offer support and companionship to older people who are socially isolated.</li>
                <li><strong>Dementia caf√©s</strong>, we provide an advisory service, reminiscence sessions and peer group support for older people who have been diagnosed with low level dementia.</li>
                <li><strong>Helping Hands Service</strong>, our Helping Hands volunteers provide help with those odd little jobs that can cause a big headache for older and vulnerable people.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you would like to request help for yourself or a loved one, please give us a call on 0300 003 1992 or fill in our <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/midmersey/about-us/contact-us/online-enquiry-form/">online enquiry form</a>.
