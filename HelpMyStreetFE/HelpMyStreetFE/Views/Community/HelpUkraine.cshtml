                            To ensure a safe and suitable environment for people arriving from Ukraine the UK Government are going to be
                            carrying out checks (background and in-person) on you as a sponsor, your family and the accommodation that
                            you will provide. You will also need photographic ID to verify your identity on our platform to accept a match.
                            The accommodation should be safe and free from health hazards, be heated and give your guests adequate access
                            to bathroom and kitchen facilities. The UK Government will also be doing checks on those arriving from Ukraine.
