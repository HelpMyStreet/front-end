      <strong>How do we collect personal data?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Directly<strong></strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>
      We obtain personal data directly from individuals in a number of different
      ways. These can include:
  </p>
  <p>
      1. via our website
      <a name="_Hlk36188556">

          email subscriptions)
      </a>
  </p>
  <p>
      2. via email (e.g. response to recruitment posts or our contact email
      addresses)
  </p>
  <p>
      3. meeting attendances (e.g. telephone/video conferences)
  </p>
  <p>
      We may also obtain personal data directly when we are establishing a

      a contract.
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Indirectly</em>
  </p>
  <p>
      We obtain personal data indirectly from a number of sources. These can
      include:

      1. recruitment services (e.g. agencies, former employers and
      recommendations)
  </p>
  <p>
      2. brought-in lists where there is a lawful basis for processing (e.g.
      referrals from other services)
  </p>
  <p>
      3. requests submitted on somebody else’s behalf
  </p>
  <p>
      4. public registers

      Our services may also include processing personal data under our clients’
      control on our hosted cloud applications, which may be governed by
      different privacy terms and policies.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>What are the categories of personal data that we collect?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      We may obtain the following categories of personal data through either
      direct interactions, client engagements, suppliers, job applications or
      other situations including those described in this Policy.
  </p>
  <p>

      <em>Special categories of personal data</em>
  </p>
  <p>
      We may collect some special categories of personal data about individuals
      where it is necessary to do so. In the event that we do process special
      categories of personal data, it is with the explicit consent of the
      individual unless it is obtained indirectly for legitimate purposes.
      Examples of special categories of personal data we may obtain include:
  </p>
  <p>
      1. health information related to an individual’s ability to fulfil their
      role (e.g. self-certifying the presence of any medical history that puts
      them at high-risk from coronavirus or presence of Coronavirus symptoms)
  </p>
  <p>
      2. personal identification documents that may reveal race or ethnic origin
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Personal data relating to criminal convictions</em>
  </p>
  <p>
      We may obtain personal data about employees, contractors or any other
      individual providing services for us that reveals information about
      criminal convictions.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>
          What are the lawful bases we use for processing personal data?
      </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      In order to process personal data we must have a lawful basis for doing so.
      We may depend on the following lawful bases when collecting and using
      personal data to perform our business activities and provide our services:
  </p>
  <p>
      1. Legal obligations and public interests: We may process personal data to
      meet certain regulatory and public interest obligations or mandates
  </p>
  <p>
      2. Legitimate interests: We may rely on legitimate interests based on our
      evaluation that the processing is fair, reasonable and balanced.
  </p>
  <p>
      3. Consent: We may rely on your freely given consent
  </p>
  <p>
      4. Contract: We may process personal data in order to preform contractual
      obligations
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>Why do we need personal data?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      We will always endeavour to explain our rationale for collecting personal
      data and maintain transparency throughout. Reasons can include:
  </p>
  <p>
      1. supporting local communities to offer and receive help during the
      Coronavirus outbreak
  </p>
  <p>
      2. providing professional advice and delivering reports related to our
      professional services
  </p>
  <p>
      3. seeking qualified candidates
  </p>
  <p>
      4. fulfilling employment or contractual obligations
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>Do we share personal data with third parties?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      Sometimes we may share personal data with trusted third parties to help us
      deliver effective and quality services. These recipients are either
      contractually bound to safeguard the data we entrust them or will sign an
      agreement to ensure this is the case. Recipients that we engage with can
      include:
  </p>
  <p>
      <a name="_Hlk36188899">
          1. parties that support us as we provide services (e.g. IT system
          support, providers of identity verification, telecommunication,
          document production, cloud-based software or other required services)
      </a>
  </p>
  <p>
      2. sub-contractors and partner organisations involved in delivering our
      professional services
  </p>
  <p>
      3. professional advisers such as lawyers and insurers
  </p>
  <p>
      4. recruitment service providers
  </p>
  <p>
      5. law enforcement and regulatory agencies
  </p>
  <p>
      We may also share your information with a third party if there is a legal
      obligation to do so (e.g. a court order), or in extreme circumstances where
      we believe it is in the service user’s best interest to do so (e.g.
      contacting the emergency services).
  </p>
  <p>
      We will also share your information with other verified local users where
      it is necessary to deliver our service. We will never share your
      information with a user that has not been verified unless you have given
      your consent to do so. Example of sharing include:
  </p>
  <p>
      1. sharing volunteer contact details with other local volunteers to help
      find local support
  </p>
  <p>
      2. sharing contact details of people requiring help to enable volunteers to
      fulfil requests
  </p>
  <p>
      3. sharing contact details of users requesting help on someone else’s
      behalf to provide an update or to request more information
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>
          Do we transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA)?
      </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      We endeavour to store personal data on servers located in the EEA. In the
      event that we store personal data outside the EEA, we will always ensure
      that appropriate safeguards are in place to guarantee individuals’ rights
      remain enforceable (such as the EU-US Privacy Shield).
  </p>

  <p>
      <strong>Personal data security</strong>
  </p>

      protect the data.
  </p>
  <p>
      Please be aware that the transmission of data via the Internet is not
      always completely secure. Whilst we will do our utmost to protect the
      security of your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your
      data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>How long do we retain personal data?</strong>

  </p>
  <p>
      2. stay in contact with you

      data for two years from the most recent engagement or processing but no
      longer than three months from the termination of the site.
  </p>
  <p>
      We will dispose of personal data in a secure manner when we no longer
      require it.

  <p>
      <strong>
          Job applicants, current and former employees (including volunteers

  </p>
  <p>
      In all instances we take steps to ensure that an adequate level of

      we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information
