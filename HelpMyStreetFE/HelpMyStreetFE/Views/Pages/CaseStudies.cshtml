                        <p>HelpMyStreet has partnered with Yoti, a leading provider of ID checking.</p>
                        <p>Every volunteer is ID-checked to confirm they are who they say they are. This is important because vulnerable people use HelpMyStreet to ask for help.</p>
                        <p>Yoti is quick and easy to use – you just need a smartphone and a valid driving licence or passport.</p>

                        <p>HelpMyStreet has an integrated task management module that matches requests for help with suitable helpers (matching by request type and proximity).</p>
                        <p>Helpers will be alerted when relevant requests for help come in, and helpers can accept as many or as few requests as they’d like. There’s no ongoing commitment – helpers are simply encouraged to help out when they have the time.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we collect feedback from everyone involved to ensure it was a positive experience.</p>

                        <p>We helped Age UK in Lincoln and South Lincolnshire launch their Vitals For Veterans campaign; a program to deliver 1,800 care packages to elderly veterans.</p>
                        <p>Every week the Age UK team find veterans who would benefit from a bit of a boost (including one gentleman who is 103 and received a parcel on his wife’s 97th birthday - quite a couple!).</p>
                        <p>They enter them into the system and then amazing Helpers sign in to HelpMyStreet, grab tasks that are close to them, pick up the parcels from a few central locations and then drop them off with the veterans.</p>
                        <p>Often they have a bit of a chat with the veteran – which is probably as important as the care package itself.</p>
