                <li>Terms applicable to volunteers and registered users
                    <ol>
                        <li>A registered user is anyone who creates an account with us, this includes volunteers and other site users. All registered users must:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Register with an email address that is personal to you. Group inboxes are not permitted to help prevent unauthorised access to personal or sensitive information. </li>
                            <li>Protect your log-in credentials to ensure no one can log-in with your details or access your account.</li>
                            <li>5.1.3.	Not create multiple accounts in your name or fraudulently in anyone else’s name.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>As a volunteer you must:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Check your inbox frequently. We may notify you of new requests for help or other important updates by email.</li>
                            <li>Only accept requests that you are willing and able to complete yourself. Once a request has been accepted by you it will not be visible to any other volunteer.</li>
                            <li>Update your accepted requests as soon as their status changes in the ‘My Requests’ area of your profile.</li>
                            <li>Keep an eye on the due date for your accepted requests. If you’re unable to complete a request in time let the person who requested the help know or release the request for another volunteer to pick up.</li>
                            <li>Keep everyone informed. Use the contact details provided to let people know you’ve picked up their request, share any updates and confirm when the task is complete.</li>
                            <li>Be mindful of requests made on someone else’s behalf. Let the help recipient know someone requested the help on their behalf and check what they need. Make sure to keep the requester informed and let them know how it went.</li>
                            <li>Offer your time and skills for free. If you have purchased something on someone else’s behalf, or incurred costs for materials or postage, you can ask for that money back, but you cannot ask for payment for your time, skills or other expenses. If you are accepting a request on behalf of a partner organisation, for example a charity organising their activities through HelpMyStreet, you must follow their processes for taking payments and reclaiming expenses.</li>
                            <li>Handle financial transactions appropriately:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Try to find alternative ways of helping without paying for things on someone else’s behalf. For example, using ‘click and collect’ services paid for by help recipient, or using a pre-paid / volunteer gift card.</li>
                                <li>Only make a purchase on someone else’s behalf if you’ve agreed it with them first and you’re happy to do so. It’s a good idea to agree a budget (including a budget per item if necessary) and how they will pay you back before you spend any money.</li>
                                <li>When requesting payment for purchases made on someone else’s behalf you should ask promptly and politely and supply a copy of the receipt where possible. Let them know how much they owe, what it was for and how they can pay you back. Always keep a copy of the receipt for your records (e.g. take a photo).</li>
                                <li>Never ask for money up front.</li>
                                <li>Never ask for credit or debit card numbers or access to people’s bank accounts.</li>
                            </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        </li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Terms applicable to people requesting help for themselves or on someone else’s behalf
                    <ol>
                        <li>People requesting help must:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Only share information which is relevant to the help request and that you’re comfortable sharing with someone you don’t yet know well.</li>
                            <li>Talk to your volunteer about any costs they may incur - e.g. the cost of your shopping if they need to buy it on your behalf – and agree how and when you can pay them back.</li>
                            <li>Be respectful of our community volunteers at all times. If you have your volunteers contact details, only contact them about the request they’re helping / have helped with unless you have consent to contact them about anything else.</li>
                            <li>Not rely on our site for support; we will do our best to find a local volunteer when you need them, but sometimes this may not be possible. For additional support in your community you can contact your local council.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </li>
